### Deployment and Operations Blueprint for AaaS MVP

This blueprint outlines the initial deployment and operational strategy for the AaaS MVP, focusing on automation, scalability, and resilience. It will cover: the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins) for automated code deployment, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) for managing cloud resources, container orchestration using Kubernetes, and fundamental operational practices for monitoring, alerting, and incident response during the MVP phase. Emphasis will be placed on establishing a repeatable, reliable, and secure deployment process.

**Core Areas:**
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated build, test, security scanning, and deployment to staging/production.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Version-controlled infrastructure definitions.
*   **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes cluster setup, deployment manifests, scaling strategies.
*   **Operational Readiness:** Runbooks for common operational tasks, basic incident response plan.
*   **Cost Management:** Initial considerations for cloud resource optimization.
